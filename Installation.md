Installation
============

Copy the git to your local machine using either Clone or downloading the zip file.

From the downloaded copy,open the file SonicPiPlaysOud.rb in a text editor
and copy the text into an emptyworkspace in Sonic Pi.

Select the folder OUD which contains the required samples, and move it to a known
absolute location on your computer. On my Pi, I have a folder called samples in my
home directory (logged on as user pi) and I place the folder inside that.
On my Mac, I have a folder called sampleson the desktop, logged on as user rbn, and
I place it there.
In the former case, the path required in the program is /home/pi/samples/OUD
In the latter it is /Users/rbn/Desktop/samples/OUD

You should then be able to run the program in Sonic-Pi
